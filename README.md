# homework_VBA
Hello!
I have a couple comments about my VBA homework:
I should confess that a couple of things don't work as expected:

1. Open Price. To write the code, i use danalogy from the class and CardChecker guiding code. However, I don't think that it picks up the right value: as written, it picks up the open price for the last day of the year. I've tried a lot of code combinations but wasn't able to figure it out

2. I wrote the code to apply the script to all woorksheets in the book... but at the end I had to run it separately for every book.

I haven't fully figured the "challenge" part. I believe I was pretty close, but not exactly.
